  - title: Cursor
    description: >-
      My main code editor. It’s very similar to VS Code, so it feels familiar, but it adds AI features that make a big difference in my workflow. The tab completion is the best I’ve used, and I like that the agentic mode lets me choose between different models depending on the task. I often use Claude Sonnet 4, GPT‑5, and GPT‑5 Mini.
  - title: OpenCode
    description: >-
      A tool I use in the terminal that works a lot like agentic mode in Cursor, but for command‑line tasks. It’s open source, has a nice terminal UI, and lets me choose from many different models depending on what I need.

      Another editor I’ve been exploring. It’s designed for speed and has a really well‑thought‑out UI. The tab completion isn’t as strong as Cursor, but the overall editing experience feels better than both Cursor and VS Code. I don’t mind giving up Cursor’s agentic mode here since I can cover that with OpenCode in the terminal.
  - title: Poimandres
    description: My favorite dark theme for VS Code.
  - title: Monaspace
    description: >-
      A superfamily of fonts from GitHub designed for programming. Its
      texture healing evens out density while preserving the grid. My favorite is Neon.
  - title: Pretty TypeScript Errors
    description: >-
      A standout VS Code extension that makes TypeScript errors much easier
      to understand at a glance.
  - title: Ghostty
    description: >-
      My terminal of choice. It’s fast, lightweight, and has a modern feel without getting in the way. I like that it’s GPU‑accelerated, supports multiplexing, and has thoughtful defaults that make it easy to use right away. It’s also open source, so I can tweak and configure it as much as I want.
