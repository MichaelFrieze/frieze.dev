  - title: MacBook Air, M1, 16GB RAM

      I used an Intel-based MacBook Pro prior to this and the difference is
      night and day. The M1 chip is so much better. I've owned this MacBook
      since 2021 and still have no reason to upgrade.
  - title: MINISFORUM HX80G, Ryzen 7 5800H, 32GB RAM, RX 6600M

      As my primary Windows machine, this mini‑PC packs a serious punch and
      works well as my gaming PC. It handles even demanding titles like Star
      Citizen without too many issues. I use my MacBook more for coding, but
      this compact system is my go‑to when I need Windows for work.
  - title: 'GIGABYTE M27Q PRO: 27" 165Hz 1440p'
    description: >-
      A great low‑cost companion for both the MacBook and the HX80G. With a
      2560×1440 resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, and FreeSync support, it
      delivers a smooth, detailed experience. The IPS panel gives accurate
      colors and wide viewing angles for both work and play.
  - title: Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro
    description: >-
      This ergonomic split keyboard uses a contoured key‑well and a columnar
      layout to reduce strain and lateral finger movement. The Pro model runs
      ZMK and is highly customizable. I use Box White switches for a
      satisfying tactile feel. After a short adjustment period, it's one of
      the best purchases I've made.
  - title: Sennheiser HD 560 S
    description: >-
      My trusty open‑back headphones for music, calls, gaming, and casual
      listening. Neutral tuning with a wide soundstage makes them great for
      long sessions, and they're very comfortable.
