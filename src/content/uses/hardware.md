  - title: MacBook Pro, M1, 16GB RAM
    description: >-
      This is my main machine for development and writing. The M1 chip is still fast and efficient, and 16GB of RAM has been plenty for my workflow. It’s quiet, reliable, and has strong battery life. I enjoy working in macOS, and the hardware itself is well‑designed and enjoyable to use. It also handles music production without issues, which is another hobby of mine. On top of that, it fits right into the Apple ecosystem, which I rely on since I use other Apple devices and so does my family.
  - title: MINISFORUM HX80G, Ryzen 7 5800H, 32GB RAM, RX 6600M
    description: >-
      My main Windows machine. Despite its compact size, it’s powerful enough to handle demanding games like Star Citizen and runs smoothly for any Windows‑specific work I need to do. I use my MacBook more for development, but this system is my go‑to when I want to game or need access to Windows.
  - title: 'GIGABYTE M27Q PRO: 27" 165Hz 1440p'
    description: >-
      A solid and affordable monitor that pairs well with both my MacBook and HX80G. The 1440p resolution and 165Hz refresh rate make it great for gaming and everyday use, and the IPS panel provides colors that are accurate enough for work.
  - title: Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro
    description: >-
      An ergonomic split keyboard with a contoured key‑well and columnar layout that helps reduce strain and finger movement. The Pro model runs ZMK, which makes it highly customizable, and I use Box White switches for a satisfying tactile feel. It took a short adjustment period, but it’s become one of the best purchases I’ve made.
  - title: Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
    description: >-
      Ergonomic vertical mouse that reduces wrist pronation and improves
      comfort. Compact and precise, it connects via Bluetooth or USB
      receiver and is comfortable for long sessions with quiet buttons.
      Runs on a single AAA battery with excellent battery life.
  - title: Sennheiser HD 560 S
    description: >-
      My go‑to open‑back headphones for music, calls, gaming, and casual listening. They have a neutral tuning with a wide soundstage, which makes them great for long sessions, and the lightweight design keeps them comfortable to wear.
  - title: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)
    description: >-
      Wireless earbuds with excellent noise cancellation and a natural‑sounding transparency mode. They’re comfortable enough for long sessions, switch seamlessly between my devices, and the sound quality is pretty good.
  - title: Apple iPhone 16 Pro
    description: >-
      The phone I use for communication, photos, and apps. I stick with the iPhone because it integrates well with my other Apple devices, and it makes everyday things like syncing, sharing, and staying connected with my family simple. It’s fast, reliable, and well-designed.
