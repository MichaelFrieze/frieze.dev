  - title: MacBook Pro, M1, 16GB RAM
    description: >-
      This is my main machine for development and everyday use. The M1 chip is still fast and efficient, and 16GB of RAM has been plenty for my workflow. It's quiet, reliable, and has excellent battery life. I enjoy working in macOS, and the hardware itself is well‑designed and enjoyable to use. On top of that, it fits right into the Apple ecosystem, which I rely on since I use other Apple devices and so does my family.

      My home server running Plex and other services. It's small and powerful enough to handle media transcoding and server workloads. The Ryzen 7 5800H and 32GB of RAM provide plenty of headroom for running multiple services, and the compact form factor makes it perfect for a home server setup.
  - title: Custom Gaming PC, Ryzen 5 7600X, RTX 5060 Ti, 32GB RAM

      My main Windows machine that I use for gaming and development work. Built with an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X on an ASUS B650E‑E TUF Gaming motherboard, 32GB of G.Skill DDR5‑6000 RAM, and a GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB graphics card. The system is powered by an MSI MAG A750GL 750W 80+ Gold PSU and housed in a Lian Li O11D Mini V2 Flow case. Storage includes a Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB NVMe SSD and a WD Blue SN570 1TB NVMe SSD. The CPU is cooled by a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black, and the whole system is protected by a CyberPower CP1000PFCLCD UPS. I use WSL Ubuntu for development work.

    description: >-
      A solid and affordable monitor that pairs well with both my MacBook and custom gaming PC. The 1440p resolution and 165Hz refresh rate make it great for gaming and everyday use, and the IPS panel provides colors that are accurate enough for work.
  - title: Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro
    description: >-
      An ergonomic split keyboard with a contoured key‑well and columnar layout that helps reduce strain and finger movement. The Pro model runs ZMK, which makes it highly customizable, and I use Box White switches for a satisfying tactile feel. It took a short adjustment period, but it's become one of the best purchases I've made.
  - title: Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse
    description: >-
      Ergonomic vertical mouse that reduces wrist pronation and improves
      comfort. Compact and precise, it connects via Bluetooth or USB
      receiver and is comfortable for long sessions with quiet buttons.
      Runs on a single AAA battery with excellent battery life.
  - title: Sennheiser HD 560 S
    description: >-
      My favorite headphones for music, calls, gaming, and casual listening. They are open‑back with a neutral tuning and wide soundstage, which makes them great for the kind of music I enjoy and even suitable for music production. They're also extremely comfortable and lightweight, so I can wear them for hours without fatigue.
  - title: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)
    description: >-
      Wireless earbuds with excellent noise cancellation and a natural‑sounding transparency mode. They're comfortable enough for long sessions, switch seamlessly between my devices, and the sound quality is pretty good.
  - title: Apple iPhone 16 Pro
    description: >-
      The phone I use for communication, photos, and apps. I stick with the iPhone because it integrates well with my other Apple devices, and it makes everyday things like syncing, sharing, and staying connected with my family simple. It's fast, reliable, and well-designed.
