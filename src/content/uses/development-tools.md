  - title: VS Code
    description: >-
      While I like Vim, VS Code is my daily driver. The extensions ecosystem
      and customization make it indispensable—and honestly enjoyable—to use
      for everything from quick edits to large projects.
  - title: Codeium
    description: >-
      My favorite AI code generation tool for VS Code. I prefer it over
      GitHub Copilot, and it's free for individuals—seriously underrated.
  - title: Poimandres
    description: My favorite dark theme for VS Code.
  - title: Monaspace
    description: >-
      A superfamily of fonts from GitHub designed for programming. Its
      texture healing evens out density while preserving the grid. I like
      the Neon face (a neo‑grotesque sans).
  - title: Pretty TypeScript Errors
    description: >-
      A standout VS Code extension that makes TypeScript errors much easier
      to understand at a glance.
  - title: Obsidian
    description: >-
      My note‑taking app. I mostly use it as a simple Markdown editor, and I
      love that all notes are just local Markdown files.
