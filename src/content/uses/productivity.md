  - title: Notion
    description: >-
      I track tasks, projects, and more in Notion. I still prefer Obsidian
      for notes, but Notion is my hub for everything else.
  - title: 1Password

      Securely stores passwords and sensitive info—payment details, licenses,
      crypto wallets, SSH keys, and secure notes—with excellent autofill and
      cross‑app integration.
  - title: Perplexity

      An essential research and brainstorming assistant. Concise, well‑cited
      responses save time over traditional web searches.
  - title: Raindrop
    description: >-
      An all‑in‑one bookmark manager. Robust search helps me quickly surface
      relevant bookmarks—even when I don't remember exact titles or URLs.
