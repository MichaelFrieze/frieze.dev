  - title: Vercel
    description: My default choice for hosting Next.js and frontend apps. Git integration with preview deployments makes it easy to test and share changes, and rollbacks are seamless. It’s affordable if you manage it well, with spending limits, a built-in firewall, and attack challenge mode for protection. Fluid Compute has lowered costs, reduced cold starts, and improved performance.
  - title: Railway
    description: I often use Railway to quickly spin up databases or servers for development. It’s much easier than managing a VPS yourself, since it handles the setup and hosting for you while still giving the flexibility of running containers.
  - title: Sevalla
    description: I use Sevalla when I want something more production ready than Railway. It is like Vercel for VPS because it handles setup, Git integration with previews, networking, and even Cloudflare integration while still giving the flexibility of a full server.
  - title: DigitalOcean
    description: I use their Droplets when I need a straightforward VPS. Simple, affordable, and reliable.
  - title: Cloudflare
    description: I use Cloudflare for DNS and CDN, and sometimes Workers.
  - title: PlanetScale
    description: A reliable and high‑performance serverless MySQL platform built on Vitess, the same technology that powers YouTube. I especially like the branching feature for development and testing, as well as non‑blocking schema changes that make migrations easier.
  - title: Upstash
    description: A serverless data platform I mainly use for Redis, rate limiting, workflow, and search. It’s fast, pay‑as‑you‑go, and easy to integrate into modern React apps without managing infrastructure.
  - title: Convex
    description: My main choice for databases in apps built with TypeScript. Convex provides a real-time backend with tRPC like type safety. It is transactional by design and also supports actions and file storage. It is hosted on PlanetScale so it has excellent performance and reliability, and it is built by the same team that created Dropbox.
  - title: Clerk
    description: A hosted auth solution I reach for when I want something full-featured and easy to integrate.
  - title: PostHog
    description: My go-to for product analytics and event tracking. I like that it’s open source and self-hostable.
  - title: Sentry
    description: What I use for error tracking and performance monitoring. It’s reliable and easy to integrate.
  - title: Axiom
    description: A logging and observability platform I use for structured logs and metrics.
  - title: Inngest
    description: A tool I use for background jobs and event-driven workflows. Makes async tasks much easier.
  - title: Cloudinary
    description: A service I use for image hosting, transformations, and delivery.
  - title: Porkbun
    description: My domain registrar of choice. Simple, affordable, and reliable.
  - title: Arcjet
    description: A security tool I use that provides bot detection, rate limiting, email validation, attack protection, and data redaction.
  - title: CodeRabbit
    description: A code review assistant I use to speed up PR reviews and catch issues early.
  - title: Sanity CMS
    description: A hosted headless CMS with a great content editing experience. I like it for projects where I want an easy-to-use studio for non-developers, and it provides a flexible API for pulling content into apps.
