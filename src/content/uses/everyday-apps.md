  - title: Notion
    description: >-
      My go‑to app for notes and references. I use it to keep track of ideas, write project notes, and organize reference material.
  - title: Todoist
    description: >-
      The app I use to manage tasks and keep track of what needs to get done. I like its simple design and the fact that it works well on any platform, including the browser. Having easy access from anywhere makes it reliable for staying organized.
  - title: Raycast
    description: >-
      My launcher of choice for quickly opening apps, searching files, and running commands. I like how fast it feels and how many extensions are available to customize it. It also works well as a central hub for small tasks and even doubles as a window manager. Raycast makes macOS so much better, and I can't imagine using a Mac without it.
  - title: 1Password
    description: >-
      Securely stores passwords and sensitive information like payment details, licenses, crypto wallets, SSH keys, and secure notes. The autofill works reliably across apps and browsers, and the cross‑platform integration makes it easy to access everything wherever I'm working.
  - title: Raindrop
    description: >-
      My bookmark manager for saving and organizing links, articles, and resources. I use it to keep track of documentation, blog posts, and references I want to revisit later. The tagging and search features make it easy to find what I need, and the cross‑platform sync means my collection is always available.
  - title: T3 Chat
    description: >-
      The AI chat assistant I use most often and the only one I pay for. It's fast, has a clean interface, and feels great to use every day. I also like that it supports almost any model and is often one of the first apps to add the latest releases.
  - title: Perplexity
    description: >-
      Another AI chat assistant I use occasionally for exploring topics, answering technical questions, and summarizing articles or documentation. I like that it provides citations, which makes it easy to verify information or dig deeper when I need more context.
  - title: Microsoft Edge
    description: >-
      A browser I've been using a lot recently since I've been using Windows 11 more. It's based on Chromium, so it's fast and compatible with all the extensions I need, and it includes some useful features like better tab management and built-in tools that have grown on me over time.
  - title: Google Chrome
    description: >-
      After trying many browsers, I mostly end up sticking with Chrome. I used Arc for a while but it's no longer supported, Firefox often lags behind in supporting newer features and feels a little dated, and Vivaldi is too busy for my taste. Chrome may not have the most bells and whistles, but it's fast, reliable, and consistent.
  - title: Helium
    description: >-
      A new privacy-focused browser I've been trying out on macOS. It's based on Chromium and blocks ads, trackers, and third-party cookies by default. I like the clean, minimal interface and the built-in split view feature. It's fully open source and respects privacy without compromising on performance or compatibility with Chromium extensions.
  - title: Discord
    description: >-
      My go-to app for chatting with friends, gaming communities, and staying connected with various groups.
  - title: Slack
    description: >-
      The communication tool I use for work and professional collaboration. It's reliable for team messaging, file sharing, and integrations with other tools I use daily.
  - title: Apple Music
    description: >-
      My music streaming service of choice. It integrates seamlessly with my Apple devices and ecosystem, and I enjoy the curated playlists and radio stations. The sound quality is excellent, and having everything sync across my devices makes it convenient for listening anywhere.
