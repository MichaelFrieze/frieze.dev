      My main code editor. It’s very similar to VS Code, so it feels familiar, but it adds AI features that make a big difference in my workflow. The tab completion is the best I’ve used, and I like that the agentic mode lets me choose between different models depending on the task. I often use Claude Sonnet 4, GPT‑5, and GPT‑5 Mini.

      A tool I use in the terminal that works a lot like agentic mode in Cursor, but for command‑line tasks. It’s open source, has a nice terminal UI, and lets me choose from many different models depending on what I need.

      Another editor I’ve been exploring. It’s designed for speed and has a clean UI. The tab completion isn’t as strong as Cursor, but the overall editing experience feels better than both Cursor and VS Code. I don’t mind giving up Cursor’s agentic mode here since I can cover that with opencode in the terminal.

      A superfamily of fonts from GitHub designed for programming. Its
      texture healing evens out density while preserving the grid. My favorite is Neon.

      My terminal of choice. It’s fast, lightweight, and has a modern feel without getting in the way. I like that it’s GPU‑accelerated, supports multiplexing, and has thoughtful defaults that make it easy to use right away. It’s also open source, so I can tweak and configure it as much as I want.
