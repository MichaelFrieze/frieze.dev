  - title: Cursor

      My main code editor. It's very similar to VS Code, so it feels familiar, but it adds AI features that make a big difference in my workflow. The tab completion is the best I've used, and I like that the agentic mode lets me choose between different models depending on the task. I often use Composer 1, Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 Flash.

      A tool I use in the terminal that works a lot like agentic mode in Cursor, but for command‑line tasks. It's open source, has a nice terminal UI, and lets me choose from many different models depending on what I need.

      Another editor I've been exploring. It's designed for speed and has a clean UI. The tab completion isn't as strong as Cursor, but the overall editing experience feels better than both Cursor and VS Code.
  - title: Poimandres

  - title: Monaspace

      A superfamily of fonts from GitHub that are designed for programming. My favorite font is Neon.

      My terminal of choice. It's fast, lightweight, and has a modern feel without getting in the way. I like that it has thoughtful defaults that make it easy to use right away. It's also open source.
  - title: Windows Terminal

      My terminal of choice on Windows. It's fast, customizable, and has a nice-looking modern UI.
  - title: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
    description: >-
      I use WSL Ubuntu on my Windows machine to get a Linux development environment while still having access to Windows. It integrates with Windows Terminal and allows me to run Linux tools and commands natively. This setup gives me the best of both worlds for development work.
