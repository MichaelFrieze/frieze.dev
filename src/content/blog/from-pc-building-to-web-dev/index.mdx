_How an after-school PC building program shaped my journey into web development._

## Building My First PC

In 8th grade, my school offered an after-school program where I could either build a PC or learn Microsoft Office. I chose the PC building track, and that decision ended up shaping my career.

Building that first computer was a great experience. I learned about all the different hardware components and how they worked together. Once I got it home, I started experimenting with different Linux distributions and upgrading the hardware. Even small upgrades, like going from 256MB to 512MB of RAM, felt like a big deal back then.

Having my own computer made a huge difference. I no longer had to share the family desktop in the living room. I could explore and learn at my own pace, which was really motivating.

## Exploring Programming

As I went through high school, I started getting interested in programming. I wanted to build a music forum for my friends, so I taught myself the basics of PHP, HTML, and CSS. I think the forum software I used back then was called phpBB. That project was a good introduction to coding, even if I didn't end up pursuing it seriously at the time.

Following high school, I worked as a computer repair technician and delivered pizzas part-time.

However, in my early twenties, I felt the need for a change and enrolled at Macomb Community College (MCC). There, a Python course proved to be a turning point that reignited my interest in programming.

## Committed to Code

After my first semester at MCC, I had made up my mind. Computer science was going to be my major, and I was determined to give it my all. I didn't start my college journey until I was around 22 years old, and I believe this later start actually worked to my advantage. With a bit more maturity under my belt, I felt more focused and driven in my academic pursuits.

My strategy was to take as many relevant courses as I could at Macomb Community College before transferring to Oakland University. This approach helped me save on costs by completing my initial classes at the more affordable community college. After spending a few years at MCC, I felt well-prepared to transfer to Oakland University.

My time at Oakland University was incredibly rewarding. One instructor in particular, Preston Brooks, who taught Object-Oriented Programming II left a lasting impression on me. His background as a retired US Navy Captain gave him a clear, disciplined, and structured approach to teaching that worked well for me. I learned more from him than any other professor, and the lessons I took away went well beyond Java.

## From Student to Professional

By my second semester, I secured my first job as a Java developer, working on the [student portal](https://github.com/MichaelFrieze/MyDetails). Being part of a tight-knit enterprise development team was incredibly fulfilling. For the first time in my career, I found myself wishing the clock would slow down, as I thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with a group of dedicated and passionate individuals.

That hands-on experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in software development. I found the work to be engaging and intellectually stimulating, and it left a lasting impact on me.

## Looking Back

Reflecting on my journey, I see a path where each experience built upon the last. Building that first PC was a pivotal moment that sparked my curiosity and passion for technology. It gave me the freedom to explore and tinker independently, creating a sense of discovery and self-learning that has stayed with me throughout my career. My early coding projects in high school introduced me to web development and laid the foundation for my technical skills. College filled in a lot of gaps, deepened my understanding of programming, and helped me realize I actually wanted a career in software development.

These days I build things for the web, still driven by the same curiosity that started with my first PC. This journey has been a lot of fun and I'm grateful for the experiences that have shaped my path to where I am now.
