_How an after-school PC building program shaped my journey into web development._

## Building My First PC

Back in 8th grade, my school offered an after-school program that really sparked my interest in computers and technology. We had two options - build our own PC or learn Microsoft Office. I chose the computer building track, and that decision ended up shaping the course of my entire career.

Building that first computer from scratch was such a rewarding experience. I loved learning about all the different hardware components and how they fit together. Once I got that machine home, I couldn't wait to start tinkering with it. I immediately began experimenting with different Linux distributions, seeing what I could customize and optimize. Upgrading the RAM from 256MB to 512MB felt like a major accomplishment back then.

Having my own personal computer to play with was a game-changer. Up until that point, I had only used the family desktop in the living room. But now I had a machine that was truly mine, where I could explore and learn at my own pace. That sense of ownership and freedom to tinker was incredibly motivating.

## Exploring Programming

As I progressed through high school, I was getting interested in programming. I wanted to build a music forum for me and my friends, so I taught myself the basics of PHP, HTML, and CSS. I think the forum software I used back then was called phpBB. That project was a great introduction to coding, even if I didn't end up pursuing it seriously at the time.

Instead, I was more into computer repair work, taking on jobs fixing up desktops and laptops. That hands-on technical experience was helpful and I enjoyed working as a computer repair technician, but I still felt like something was missing. It wasn't until I took a Python class at the local community college that I rediscovered my passion for programming. That course reignited my curiosity and made me realize that computer science was the path I wanted to pursue.

## Transitioning to Web Development

After transferring to Oakland University, I landed my first job as a Java developer working on the student portal. Getting that real-world experience as part of a development team was incredibly rewarding. It solidified my decision to commit to a career in software development, and I haven't looked back since.

The lessons I learned and the skills I developed have been invaluable, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that set me on this fulfilling path.
